# Analytic Functions and Bilinear Mappings 

# By: Riddhi B. Mehta

Hey friends !
Here I come with another upload of Engineering Mathematics subject - Analytic Functions and Bilinear Mappings. 

I hope my previous notes have been helping you!

This PDF is in 2 parts and overall the topics covered are:

1. Complex Variables
2. Cauchy Riemann Equations
3. Analytic Functions
4. Harmonic Functions and Orthogonal Trajectories
5. Milne Thompson Method 
6. CR Equations in Polar Form
7. Complex Mappings
8. Bilinear Transformation

Have fun and #practice!
