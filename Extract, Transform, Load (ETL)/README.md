# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process

# By: Riddhi Mehta

Hello and Welcome!

There is only 1 .PDF file attached for this subject. These notes cover the syllabus of ETL Process subject, and the file has been organised in a question - answer format for a much faster understanding of the subject as well as for quicker preparation of test / semester exam. 

Kindly give these notes a try, and do let me know if there are any questions missing. I would be more than happy to modify and add more material. 

# Thank You.
