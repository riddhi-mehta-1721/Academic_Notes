# Academic Notes (by Riddhi Mehta)

Hello Everyone !!

My name is Riddhi Mehta and I am currently pursuing BTech in Data Science from NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have been asked many times, "Riddhi, why do you make such detailed notes? Are you even going to refer to it again?" to which I really never had any reply. But this coronavirus pandemic lockdown has led to many great realisations, and I believe that my notes could be valuable to my juniors who will be studying the same subjects as I studied. And, if I have the opportunity to share my notes with them on this platform, I should take that step and do it !

So dear friends, please go ahead and make full use of my notes as they are detailed and very specific to the syllabus of the subjects. 

(These notes are not restricted to just my juniors but also to everyone else who wish to study them!)

# Thank You.
